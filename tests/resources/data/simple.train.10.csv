I am so obsessed with it, I went out and pre-ordered the Wind Waker to get the Zelda bonus disc and renewed my subscription twice to Nintendo Power to get the Zelda Collector's Edition disc.There is no need for me to review this game - all I really need to say is buy it.  You will not be disappointed (if you are a nintendo fan or have a brain).  Definitely be sure to get the follow up Majora's Mask and the Wind Waker.

The level's are great and there is alot to do. The places that you go are in the mountain's lake's valley's and in cave's and a little ranch somewhere? Link lives in Kokiri Forest.In the game you have to get three stones somewhere. One in the Deku Tree and One in Goron City and One in the Zora's Domain. Some time in the game you will be older, by the time you look around the place will be dead.You as Link and you have to save the world form evil form the evil king name Ganondori and his evil plan's before it's too late. And save a beautiful princess name Zelda. And you get to meet other characters in the game too some are cool some are big and some are small.Buy the (The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of time Official Strategy Guide) it's a big help to me and you if you with it.Everything Revealed to YOU.PS.

I didn't know much about Zelda, and had only played very few games before, but was mesmerized by this game. The beginning of it is so magical and imaginative; it really draws you in to the story. I found myself playing through the beginning of it over and over again because I didn't have my memory card yet. This game takes place in a vivid fantasy world that is vibrant, ominous, beautiful, and haunting. I had never experienced anything like it. To this day I have never been so absorbed by another game.What's really impressive is that this whole game is very consistent. The music is also exceptional. The music is better than most movie soundtracks, in my opinion. All of it perfectly accompanies what is happening in the game. So much happens in this game; it has a lot of cinematic scenes too, which really develop the story, which is an excellent tale of good versus evil.Ocarina of Time stimulated my imagination at a young age more than just about anything I know of. There are a few films and books that would come close, but I can't think of anything that could quite surpass it. Ocarina of Time is an involving, authentic, scary, and epic adventure. Playing it for the first time makes for an unparalleled experience.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My Favorite Game", "unixReviewTime": 1372032000, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2013"}

It is definitely the best game in the Zelda series so far.  It has adventure, romance, mystery, and SO many subquests.  It's about a boy named Link who has a destiny.  He lives in Kokiri Village, a little tiny village in the land of Hyrule.  Anyway, a little fairy named Navi comes and says that he must meet the Deku Tree.  He does and the Deku Tree tells him to go inside the Deku Tree and destroy all of the evil monsters inside him.  Link does this and the Deku Tree gives him the Kokiri Emerald, or the Spiritual Stone of Forest.  The Deku Tree phrophesies that Ganondorf, an evil desert Gerudo man, is trying to get hold of the Triforce, the essence of life in Hyrule.  But in order to get hold of the Triforce you have to get three of the spiritual stones.  Unfortuantely, after the tree's prophecy, he died because of the curse Ganondorf had cast upon him.  But Link and Navi go on their journey and get the Goron's Ruby, or Spiritual Stone of Fire and the Zora's Sapphire, or Spiritual Stone of Water.  Link gets the Ocarina of Time but when he opens the doors Ganondorf gets in before him and he gets the Triforce.  Link waits seven years in the Chamber of Time and when he awakes he's all grown up.  Rauru, the Sage of Light is there and tells him that he must save all the Sages from their temples and receive the medallions.  He receives the Medallion of Light, Forest, Fire, Water, Shadow, and Spirit.  But the game.  It's definitely one of the best N64 games around!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Game For Masters", "unixReviewTime": 994464000, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2001"}

This is it. Look no further than the game that changes everything that went before it. Yes, certainly other games can compete graphically with this, but innovation is an entirely different proposition. Zelda, then, innovates on an unparalleled scale. Weather, night/day, age, all real aspects which merely touch the surface of this monumentous achievement.To be really honest, there is no real weakness with this game. No puzzle will stop you in your tracks. There is ALWAYS something to do. In fact it will take you a lot longer to find everything the game has to offer than it would to finish other games. And this is where the distinction comes in. You can label this as an adventure game if you like. But, it is beyond comparison with everything else. Thus meaning that it should be catagorised in a genre by itself. Or at least as a game that redefines an entire genre.There are no comparisons. Forget other inferior games that try and emulate and 'better' this. Forget the games that rely on pretty visuals to impress. Zelda has all these and so, so, much more.
