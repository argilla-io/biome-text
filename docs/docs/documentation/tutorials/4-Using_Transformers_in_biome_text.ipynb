    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last years we experienced a shift towards transfer learning as the standard approach to solve NLP problems. Before models were usually trained entirely from scratch, utilizing at most pretrained word embeddings. But nowadays it is very common to start with large pretrained language models as backbone of a system, and to set a task specific head on top of it. This new paradigm has made it easier to find state-of-the-art architectures for a great variety of NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all current language models are based on the transformer architecture. The awesome [Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library provides access to hundreds of such pretrained language models including state-of-the-art models such as infamous [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert), as well as community driven models often covering a specific language type or resource requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are going to classify [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) papers into [categories](https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy), analyzing the title of the paper and its abstract. We will use Hugging Face [distilled](https://medium.com/huggingface/distilbert-8cf3380435b5) implementation of [RoBERTa](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/roberta-an-optimized-method-for-pretraining-self-supervised-nlp-systems/) and explore ways how to easily include pretrained transformers in a *biome.text* pipeline."

    "### Fine-tuning the transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "In our first pipeline we follow the common approach to use pretrained transformers in classification tasks. It consists of fine-tuning the transformer weights and using a special token as pooler in the end. In our configuration the former step means setting the `trainable` parameter in the *transformers* features to `True`. The downside of fine-tuning is that most of the pre-trained transformers are relatively big and require dedicated hardware to be fine-tuned. For example, in this tutorial we will use `distilroberta-base`, a [distilled version](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/distillation) of RoBERTa with a total of ~80M parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to specify the maximum number of input tokens `max_length` supported by the pretrained transformer. If you are sure that your input data does not exceed this limit, you can skip this parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "With BERT-like models, such as RoBERTa, a special [CLS] token is added as first token to each input. It is pretrained to effectively represent the entire input and can be used as pooler in the head component. Many BERT like models pass this token through a non-linear tanh activation layer that is part of the pretraining. If you want to use these pretrained weights you have to use the `bert_pooler` together with the corresponding `pretrained_model`. We will fine-tune these weights as well (setting `require_grad` to `True`) and add a little dropout.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: tip Tip\n",
