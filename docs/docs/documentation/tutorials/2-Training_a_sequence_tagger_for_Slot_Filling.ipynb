    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will train a sequence tagger for filling slots in spoken requests.\n",
    "The goal is to look for specific pieces of information in the request and tag the corresponding tokens accordingly. \n",
    "The requests will include several intents, from getting weather information to adding a song to a playlist, each requiring its own set of slots.\n",
    "Therefore, slot filling often goes hand in hand with intent classification.\n",
    "In this tutorial, however, we will only focus on the slot filling task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slot filling is closely related to [Named-entity recognition (NER)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) and the model of this tutorial can also be used to train a NER system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will use the [SNIPS data set](https://github.com/snipsco/nlu-benchmark/tree/master/2017-06-custom-intent-engines) adapted by [Su Zhu](https://github.com/sz128/slot_filling_and_intent_detection_of_SLU/tree/master/data/snips) and our simple [data preparation notebook](https://biome-tutorials-data.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/token_classifier/data_prep.ipynb)."
