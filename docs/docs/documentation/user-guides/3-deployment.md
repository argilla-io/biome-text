# Deployment

*Biome.text* provides an easy to use built-in tool to deploy your model on a local machine as a REST API via [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).
Additionally, you can easily export your pipeline to an [MLFlow Model](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#mlflow-models)
and take advantage of all its deployment tools like packaging the model as self-contained Docker image with a REST API endpoint,
or deploying it directly on Microsoft Azure ML or Amazon SageMaker.
